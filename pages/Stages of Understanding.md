What does it mean to [[Understand]]`? While washing dishes, I suddenly thought about the question [What is Understanding?] and quickly jotted down my thoughts.`

In response to the question "What is X?"

Level 0 Understanding:
- Unable to answer the question at all.

Level 1 Understanding:
- Can quote something written in another book or source in response to the question.
- Personally, I would like to categorize this as 'not understanding' and place it in Level 0.
- However, I refrained from doing so to avoid confusing readers before getting to the main point.
- In school exams, if you remember the textbook content and can quote it in response to a time-limited question, you can get good grades.
- This has created a social convention that such behavior equates to 'understanding'.
- It was only a training method useful when humans had no computers to install knowledge.
- It's merely measuring 'installation efficiency'.
- If we consider this as 'understanding', then search engines is entities with higher levels of understanding than humans.
- [[When you don't understand, you can only quote]]
    - Quote from "[[Phenomenology as non-logical steps]]" by Eugene Gendlin (1989).

Level 2 Understanding:
- Can answer the question in your own words, not just with quotes.
- [[Feynman]]
    - [[You can test if you understand the meaning of words by explaining without using those words.]]
- Being able to answer 'in your own words' and 'whether the explanation is true' are unrelated.
    - [["Combustion is the process of releasing a substance called phlogiston"]] --- An incorrect explanation of combustion: [Phlogiston Theory - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%83%AD%E3%82%AE%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%B3%E8%AA%AC)
    - [[Understanding is a hypothesis]] and 'whether the hypothesis is correct' requires verification after the hypothesis is formed.
        - There are people who can and cannot create hypotheses.
        - The ability to create a hypothesis is considered a deeper understanding.

Level 3 Understanding:
    - Can express the question in a form of an experiment that is verifiable.
    - Level 2 focused on whether it's possible to explain in words.
        - There's room for choice in these 'words':
            - Can explain in natural language.
            - Can implement in a programming language.
    - When implemented in a programming language, the behavior of the implementation allows for verification of the correctness of the understanding.
        - [[Falsifiability]] is introduced to understanding.
    - It's not limited to programming; the important thing is being able to 'express it in a form of a verifiable experiment'.
    - It's a clearer form compared to unverifiable discourse.

This page is written because I have reached a 'Level 2 Understanding' of 'Understanding'.
- Whether what I have written here is correct or not will be verified after reaching Level 3 Understanding.
