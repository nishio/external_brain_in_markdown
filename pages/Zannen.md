<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> The Japanese word "[[残念]]" (Zannen) is commonly used to express disappointment or regret. It is often translated as "it's a shame" or "it's unfortunate" in English. However, just like many other words, "残念" carries specific cultural nuances that might not be directly translatable.

In the Japanese language, "残念" is typically used in a wide range of scenarios, from minor disappointments to serious setbacks. For example, if you had plans to go out with friends but the weather turned bad, you might say "残念" to express your disappointment. On the other hand, you could also use it to express sympathy towards someone who didn't achieve something they worked hard for, like failing an important exam.

"残念" can also be used to gently criticize someone's actions or behavior. This is often seen in Japanese TV shows or anime, where a character might say "残念" to imply that someone's actions were less than ideal, disappointing, or missed the mark.

In addition to expressing one's own feelings, "残念" is also often used in a polite and indirect manner to express what could be perceived as negative feedback. It's one of the many ways that the Japanese language tends to prioritize harmony and avoid direct confrontation.

In short, understanding the full meaning and usage of "残念" not only requires a grasp of the language but also an understanding of the cultural context in which it is used. It embodies certain aspects of Japanese communication, such as the focus on harmony, indirectness, and subtlety.
