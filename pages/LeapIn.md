In order to move forward we would like to clarify a few things:

1) Do you sell only ebooks, or are you planning on selling physical books as well?

2)You have indicated that in addition to transactions in EUR, you are also planning to do transactions in USD.

Our partner bank (www.lhv.ee) multi-currency account does accept EUR and other currencies but does not accept USD transfers at the moment. This limitation applies to incoming and outgoing wire transfers and settlements.

To solve existing pain, LeapIN and LHV offers the following workarounds:
your customer pays USD to Paypal > you convert USD to EUR in Paypal > you settle EUR from Paypal to LHV account
your customer pays USD (only from U.S. bank) using LHV Transferwise solution ([https://www.lhv.ee/en/transferwise)](https://www.lhv.ee/en/transferwise))
open up a Transferwise Borderless USD account (important! transfers from US bank accounts only, no SWIFT international payments)
