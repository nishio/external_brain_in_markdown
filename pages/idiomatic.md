idiomatic
- > I have attached your Preface, which I edited. Please look at it and tell me if this is the way you would like me to continue. By making the language more idiomatic, I will also be able to pick up other issues. Please note that this is just a first edit.

- idiomaticなのは良いのか悪いのか
- 英語圏の読者にはeasy to understandかもしれないが、翻訳時の障害になる
