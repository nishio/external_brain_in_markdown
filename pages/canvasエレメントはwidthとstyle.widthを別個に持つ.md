> Note further that the height and width are the logical canvas dimensions used for drawing and are different from the style.height and style.width CSS attributes.
:

```
// Make a canvas that has a blurry pixelated zoom-in
// with each canvas pixel drawn showing as roughly 2x2 on screen
canvas.width  = 400;
canvas.height = 300; 
canvas.style.width  = '800px';
canvas.style.height = '600px';
```
