In Japan, it is a traditional symbol that represents good fortune and well-being. The manji is often found in religious contexts, particularly in Buddhism, where it symbolizes eternal life or cyclicality.

It's important to know that the manji is different from the swastika used by the Nazis during World War II. The Nazi Hakenkreuz is usually at a 45-degree angle and has a different historical and cultural background.

In Japan, the manji is used in maps to mark the location of Buddhist temples. It's also seen in decorations and designs. Because of its sacred meaning in Buddhism and other Eastern religions, the manji is respected and holds a positive significance.
