[[5人でユーザテストすればユーザビリティ上の問題の85%が見つかる]]的なニュアンスで、数十人でPolisすればより良い思考には十分な気がする
- もちろんその数十人がみんな同じ属性だったりすると良くないわけだが

> [nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1656031177520857089) I said as below to GPT4 and it ask me interesting question
>
>  Nishio: It seems many Japanese don't see the need for decentrized IDs.
>  However, Japanese culture values consensus making.
>  So, "broad listening" is key to promoto Plurality in Japan.
>  It is beneficial for Japanese to make oppotunity to experience broad listening.
>  So I hosted conversations on Polis and got participated by hundreds of participants.
>
>  GPT: I'm curious, what were some of the insights or outcomes that emerged from these discussions?

> [nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1656031345448198144) I come up with three insights. First, people use the same word in the different meanings. Second, some people think some comments are irrelevant to the topic, but it is correlated to the opinion groups. Third, when we got too many comments, many people frowned.

> [nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1656031861309849600) GPT4: The issue of too many comments causing frustration is also a significant one. ... I'm curious how you plan to manage this issue.

> [@nishio_en](https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1656034436650237952): For the issue of too many comments, I have a plan to use [[market mechanism]]s. With N voters, a single post costs N vote efforts. So I’m introduce a credit and require N credits for posting an issue. People can earn the credits by voting. Because [[voting is a kind of work for common goods]].
