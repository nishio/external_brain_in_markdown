<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/> "[[尊王攘夷]]" (Sonno Joi) is a historical Japanese political philosophy and slogan that played a significant role during the Bakumatsu period, which refers to the final years of the Edo period when the Tokugawa shogunate ended. This era was marked by significant changes in Japan's political and social structure in response to contact with Western nations.

The term "尊王攘夷" is composed of two parts. The first part "尊王" (Sonno) translates to "revere the Emperor". During the Edo period, Japan was ruled by shoguns from the Tokugawa family, while the Emperor was a religious and symbolic figure with little political power. The idea of "尊王" called for a return of political power to the Emperor.

The second part "攘夷" (Joi) means "expel the barbarians". This is in reference to the Western powers, mainly the United States and European nations, who were seeking to end Japan's isolationist foreign policy known as Sakoku. The proponents of "攘夷" sought to resist Western influence and maintain the integrity of Japan by rejecting treaties and maintaining isolation.

So, "尊王攘夷" as a whole advocated for the restoration of the Emperor's power and the expulsion of foreign powers from Japan. This movement significantly influenced the Meiji Restoration, which eventually restored the Emperor's power and modernized Japan, although it did not expel foreigners as initially desired.
