[[IQの高さをアイデンティティにする人の危うさ]]

忙しくて昨日の英語の復習がまだ終わってないとか言いながら関係ないことをしてんじゃん
- なぜそれが起こるか
- それは「思ったより時間がかかる」という経験によってタスクの見積もりサイズが大きくなり、開始の心理的ハードルが高くなったからである
- 毎日2コマ、80分の英会話テキストが生まれる
- 睡眠を削るのをやめると、これを処理する時間が足りない
    - これはそう感じているだけであって事実ではない
    - 実際には上記のようにエネルギーが漏れてしまっている
- タスクを減らすべきだ
- 単に量を減らすのではなく、よく観察して不要な要素を減らす
- 観察
    - 文字起こししたものを即座にScrapboxに貼っている
        - それは必要ではない
    - 他人が会話文として読んで面白いように整理してる
        - それは必要ではない
    - 復習すべきフレーズの抽出
        - 「復習すべき」とは？
            - real-life situationで使いそうなものということ

    - 手作業で刻んでChatGPTに貼り付ける時間は無駄
        - 適度に刻んでGPT4に渡すスクリプトを書いて自動化した
        - ✅今はコンソールにはいてるけどファイルに吐くようにする
        - ✅エラー時のリトライが手動だが、それも自動にする
            - ✅手動リトライの時の操作ミスで２つ目のレッスンの頭が切れてる、そこだけやり直し
        - Wisperの処理が終わり次第それをやるようにする
        - There are two kind of transcription, one is the raw transcripton by Whisper, and the refined transcription by GPT4
        - Sometimes the refined transcripton has errors. In the case I have read the raw one and fixed the errors. However, I shouldn't do that. The major reason of those errors is my pronunciation, and the instructor didn't correct it. So those are not severe errors.

夕食後眠くなるがウォーキングをして眠気を飛ばす
- ここ2日睡眠不足の解消に集中して少し体調が戻った
- 夕食後に1〜2時間寝ると元気になりすぎで夜に寝なさすぎる

English learing memo

Hello, nice to meet you. I've read some of your works about X.
Let me introduce myself. My name is Hirokazu Nishio, call me Hiro.
I'm a researcher in a software company.
When I was in the doctoral cource, my major was visualization of high-dimensional data.
I've been interested in augumentation of human ability in these years.
I've read about the term 'broad listening' in your work.
I think the "broad listening" is a kind of human augumentation. It is interesting for me.

I'm from Osaka, but I have lived in Tokyo for 20 years.
I like playing games, but recently I don't have enough time to play games because I have a lot of English lessons.

B: I have a lot of English lessons.
A: Why is that?
B: In the middle of this month, foreign person will visit us from around the world.

That's really nice to hear.

I recently developed an automatic translation system for my personal wiki. I've written over 10,000 pages, which are being translated into English daily.

My company's vision is "building a society brimming with teamwork."
To make teamwork better, we need to understand how the team members feel. So the broad listening plays important role.

If you don't mind, I'd like to tell you another topic.


生身の人間は100人が話すことを聞くことはできない

A: Does that make sense?

B: I'm not quite sure if I understand it correctly. Can you please explain?

With digital technology, we can do much more thing. For example, calculating large numbers rapidly and communicating with people oversea.

コンピュータは疲れずに24時間働き続けることができる。

I recently made a system to transcribe our recordings of our conversations into text.
So you could probably sell that program and make a lot of money.
- めんどくさいからやりたくない
- I don't want to make it public because there are a lot of components and to describe how to use the system is a heavy task for me. To make a document for beginners is not interesting for me.


B: The company of ChatGPT  offer an API for us, so we can use the API to call ChatGPT from our program.
A: Do they offer the API for free?
B: No, it's not free. It costs, but it's not too expensive. However, because it's not free, if I offer the program for free, I have to pay a lot of money. So it's not good for me. I need to implement a way to collect money from users. But I'm not interested in that. If I made it, I will make money, but it's not interesting. Many people try to create such a system, so there will be high competition. I'm not interested in competing.

your system is very impressive.

[[人間の能力を拡張することに興味を持ったきっかけは？]]

There's a chance sales will rebound.
If sales rebound, we won't lose our jobs.

A: Our ovens sell very well in the United States. They are high quality even at a low cost, and since they are so large, you can cook many things in them. We have brought them to Japan, but unfortunately, they are not selling well here. So, I'm wondering if you can help me figure out why.
B: Have you visited a Japanese house before?
A: No, we haven't.
B: I think you should visit several model houses to see the actual size of Japanese houses. I believe your oven might be too big for Japanese kitchens. Japanese houses are generally small, and there might not be a place to put the oven in their kitchen.
A: Where do people put their ovens now?
B: Usually, they use a cabinet to put an electric oven, sometimes of a similar size. But from my experience, many people use all-in-one electric ovens with hot wind and water features.
A: Are they like toaster ovens?
B: Sorry, what does that means?
A: A toaster oven is for toasting bread and making small things. (showing a figure) This is a toaster oven.
B: It is a little smaller than I imagined. I'm thinking on an electric oven, like an electric range.
A: Ah, the stove top.
B: Stove top?
A: Yes, where you cook.
B: I think, cultural differences between Japan and the U.S. can cause differences in the words used to describe cooking tools, their meaning, size, and concept. It might be helpful to visit an electric store and see what's common in Japan.
B: That's a good idea.
