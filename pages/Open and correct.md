<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon' alt='GPT.icon' height="19.5"/> The Japanese phrase "[[公明正大]]" (koumei-seidai) is a concept that can be translated into English as "[[fair and square]]", "[[just and upright]]", or "[[open and aboveboard]]". This term embodies the idea of conducting oneself with utmost transparency, fairness, righteousness, and integrity.

The first character, "[[公]]" (kou), implies [[public]], fair, or impartial. The second character, "[[明]]" (mei), means [[bright]], clear, or open. These two characters together (公明/koumei) suggest an openness and transparency in one's actions and intentions, where there is no hidden agenda or dishonesty.

The third character, "[[正]]" (sei), means [[correct]], right, or just, while the final character "[[大]]" (dai) means [[big]], great, or large. When combined (正大/seidai), these characters convey a sense of grand righteousness or the idea of being upright and just in one's actions.

So, "公明正大" as a whole refers to a way of behaving that is honest, transparent, and righteous, with a sense of fairness and integrity in one's actions. This concept is greatly respected in Japanese society and is seen as an ideal way of conducting oneself, particularly in positions of leadership or authority.
