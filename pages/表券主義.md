[[徴税能力]]が[[通貨の価値の源泉]]という考え方
- 「不換紙幣が交換価値を持つのは、発行した通貨で支払われる経済活動に対して[[課税]]できる主権があるからだ」

[[Chartalism]] [Chartalism - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartalism)
> In macroeconomics, chartalism is a heterodox theory of money that argues that money originated historically with states' attempts to direct economic activity rather than as a spontaneous solution to the problems with barter or as a means with which to tokenize debt, and that fiat currency has value in exchange because of sovereign power to levy taxes on economic activity payable in the currency they issue.
