<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> "Itako" is a term in Japanese that refers to a type of [[spiritual medium]], traditionally a [[blind woman]], who can purportedly communicate with spirits in Japanese folk religion. Itako are often associated with [[Shinto]]ism and folk practices in certain regions of Japan, especially in the [[Tohoku]]([[Iwate]]) region.

These spiritual mediums play a significant role in conducting rituals and ceremonies, which typically involve invoking the spirits of the dead and facilitating communication between the living and the spirit world. The Itako perform these rituals through a practice called "[[kuchiyose]]," or spirit possession, which is believed to allow them to communicate directly with spirits.

Historically, blind women often became Itako as a means of supporting themselves, as there were limited career opportunities available for people with disabilities. They would undergo a rigorous training process, often starting from a young age, to learn the skills and practices needed to become a medium.

However, the practice of Itako is becoming increasingly rare in modern Japan due to various reasons, including the changing views on spiritualism and the increased career opportunities for people with disabilities. As a result, the Itako tradition is largely considered to be a dying art.

While it's important to remember that the understanding and acceptance of practices like the Itako vary greatly both within and outside of Japan, the Itako provide a unique insight into the spiritual and cultural practices of the country.
