**What is Saichugen?
Saichugen(最中限; in English, most mediocre) is a card game for three players. It uses a deck of playing cards without jokers. Its rule characterized by the concept of median; the value which is equal or more than another value and equal or less than the other value. The objective of the game is to have the median at the completion of the game. There are 5 rounds in 1 game and 3 turns(tricks) in 1 round. Winner of a round and a trick also determine in a median fashion.

**Rule
*** Dealing
Shuffle the deck and deal 17 cards for 3 players. The last card of deck is not used in the game. Make its face down.

*** Turn(Trick)
Each player plays a card face down, and then opens it in same time. The most 'mediocre' card win the turn, neither the strongest nor the weakest. Aces are most weakest number and kings are most strongest. In case there are cards of same number the suits of the cards are considered. "Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clovers" stronger preceded. The defeated cards are let face down again.

*** Round
Repeat 3 turns. And then calculate the score of the round. The score is total of number of your opened cards in the round. If you have no opened cards your score is 0. If you have an opened card 7 your score is 7. If you have two opened cards 7 and 5 your score is 12. The median scored player win the round. The defeated player make their cards in the round face down again. They also lost the round score, that is, they get 0 points at this round.

Notice if there are two or three median player, all of them win the game. When only one player got score (e.g. scores for each player are 0, 0, 23), the median is 0 and winners get 0 points.

*** Game
Deal cards and repeat 5 rounds. And then total scores of all rounds. Winner of the game is the median scored player. When a number of winner is 1, winner get +2 points and loser get -1 points. When a number of winner is 2, winner get +1 points and loser get -2 points. The point is to make it a zero-sum game.

*1226653357*新宿わからない
新宿で晩御飯の待ち合わせ。ジュンク堂に行ったことがあるから早目にいってそこで待とうと思った。乗り過ごして一度笹塚に寄ったあと駅について、さてジュンク堂はY字路の手前だ、と思ったがY字路がない。あれれ。

-----

地図をよく見てもどう回しても僕の知っているY字路にならない。しばらく考えたあげく、Y字路の手前にジュンク堂があるのは新宿ではなく池袋だと言う結論に到達。仕方がないので携帯で新宿のジュンク堂の位置を調べて地図を出す。自分は今西口にいるのでとりあえず東口に向かう。

-----

30分くらい迷う。結局「地図見ろ」とか「GPS付きの携帯買え(iPhone)」とか色々言われた。でも、自分の位置は地図を見て把握していて、目的地の地図も手元にある上で迷っているわけで、GPSでは解決できないと思うんだよな。NAVITIMEで本当にあのナビの人が出てきて「西口から東口に行きたいの？それならあっちあっち、そこを曲がって」と言ってくれるなら契約するんだが。
