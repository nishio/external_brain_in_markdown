実験1
- パズルを解いて、それから下記の掲示を見てから、もう一度パズルを解く
    - 基準群:
        - > You will now be asked to complete the second round of the MATH BRAIN TEASER. As before, you will have 20 seconds to find the right solution in each of the five math puzzles in this round.
    - 熟考群:
        - > Please take the next few minutes to reflect on the task you just completed. Please write about what strategies if any you used as you were working on the task. Also please write about what you think one can do to be effective in solving the math problems included in this task. Please be as specific as possible. When done, click on “Next.”
    - 共有群
        - >  Please take the next few minutes to think about the task you just completed. Please write about what strategies if any you used as you were working on the task. Also please write about what you think one can do to be effective in solving the math problems included in this task. Please be as specific as possible. PLEASE NOTE: Your notes will be shared with other participants who are asked to work on the same Brain Teaser task. When done, click on “Next.”

熟考群と共有群は基準群に比べて有意に成績が良い。
共有群は熟考群より平均が高い傾向がみられるが、統計的に有意というほどではない。

フィールドテスト
- コールセンター業務のトレーニング
- 従来4週間のトレーニングと2週間のOJTでトレーニングしていた
- この中に10日間「15分考察」を入れる
- > Please take the next 15 minutes to reflect on the training day you just completed. Please write about the main key lessons you learned as you were completing your training. Please reflect on and write about at least two key lessons. Please be as specific as possible.
- 共有群においては、10分考察して書き、5分同僚にそれを説明する
- > Please take the next 10 minutes to reflect on the training day you just completed. Please write about the main key lessons you learned as you were completing your training. Please reflect on and write about at least two key lessons. Please be as specific as possible. When done, you will be given another 5 minutes to explain these to another participant who is completing the training process with you.
最終アセスメントテストにおいて、熟考群は22.8%、共有群は25.0%の成績向上につながった。
基準群との差は統計的有意である。
熟考群と共有群の差は統計的有意とはいえない。
