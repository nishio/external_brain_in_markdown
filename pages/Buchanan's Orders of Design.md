「デザイン」を4つの階層で説明する
- それぞれの階層の呼び名には揺れがありそう
    - 見た目/Graphic/Symbolsのデザイン
    - 工業製品/Industrial/Thingsのデザイン
    - 相互作用/Interaction/Actionのデザイン
    - システム/System/環境/Environmentのデザイン

- 「システム」は物のシステムに限らない
    - 人のシステムなども含む
    - > The focus is no longer on material systems—systems of “things”—but on human systems, the integration of information, physical artifacts, and interactions in environments of living, working, playing, and learning.
    - 人とコンピュータのインタラクションだけではなく、人と人のインタラクションまで広げる
- 「システム」という言葉の解釈に少し僕と違う属性がついてる
    - 「誰もシステム全体を見ることはできない」
    - > I believe that one of the most significant developments in systems thinking is the recognition that human beings can never see or experience a system, yet we know that our lives are strongly influenced by systems and environments of our own making and by those that nature provides.
    - 部分的な観測しかできない中でシンボルを作り出すことで組織化しようとする

- [Four Orders of Design - Richard Buchanan - InovagovInovagov](http://inova.gov.br/four-orders-of-design-richard-buchanan/)
- "The first order of design is communication with symbols and images.
- The second order of design is design of artefacts as in engineering, architecture, and mass production.
- In the middle of the 20th century we realised that we can also design activities and processes. We work progressively more with these activities and services. That’s the third order of design. In the beginning we called it Human Computer Interaction. Now we work with any kind of interaction – it’s about how people relate to other people. We can design those relationships or the things that support them. It’s this interaction I’m after.
- The fourth order of design is the design of the environments and systems within which all the other orders of design exist. Understanding how these systems work, what core ideas hold them together, what ideas and values – that’s a fourth order problem. Both the third and the fourth order are emerging now very strongly.
- Some designers have the ability to deal with these very complex questions that lie at the core of our social life. Not every designer, but some have the ability to grasp the ideas and the values at the core of very complicated systems. Those are fourth order designers".
