Encounter with Plurality

"Plurality: Technology for Collaborative

Technology... Collaborative Diversity...
Oh, it's about Technology to "build a society
brimming with teamwork" !
協働的多様性のための技術... これは「チームワークあふれる社会を創る」 技術だ!
"people can hear the distilled essence of the
distribution of opinion of their peers,
empowering democratic deliberation at scale"

Oh, it is a technology that augment the

So I made Japanese Translation Forum
![image](https://gyazo.com/81c4ec60826b273b033eb281160cb2c0/thumb/1000)
System Overview
• Source of the book is on Github repository
• I forked that repository and
●
implemented automated
●
daily translation flow
using the GPT-3.5 API
Then, considering the need
for a space where Japanese
people could freely discuss
the contents of this book
in Japanese,
I created the forum
using Scrapbox.

Good understanding is the
foundation of good translation
. The translation is a distant goal.
The base text has not yet been finalized.
●
• Therefore, we are not limited to the content of the book.
We also translate more compact finalized peripheral
information.

How can a better
understanding be created?

![image](https://gyazo.com/cf4c46c1b2d61d3d8de27676611ebd5b/thumb/1000)
Building network of knowledge
Example: Here is a slide from Glen's talk
Definition
Technology to facilitate collaboration across
social differences.

Building network of knowledge
It links to a page:
Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations
"Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. Symbolizing the elements that create truth and beauty."
- Spock 2, 2269 ("The Infinite Vulcan")

![image](https://gyazo.com/bd67996644796896ae2669182dc5dc0f/thumb/1000)
Building network of knowledge
And then you will see this
Vulcan belief that beauty, growth, progress -- all result from the union of the unlike

The process of tying two
items together is the
important thing.... he builds
a trail of his interest ... his
trails do not fade.
-Vannevar Bush (1945)

Road:
infrastructure for good understanding
By storing "trails of interest" as links, roads are created.
●
●
Then those roads help the understanding of those who
come later, just as roads assist in the movement of people
We are homesteading the world of knowledge.
("Homesteading the Noosphere" by Eric S. Raymond in mind)
It is an implementation of:

Two languages
Interesting observation
. There are two languages
in the plurality repository.


When I tried using both as inputs for machine translation,
I often found that translations from Mandarin resulted
in more natural Japanese than from English.

Another Example:
In Glen's "Why I Am a Pluralist”(2022)
and Its Mandarin version: 為何 我 是 多元宇宙人
我借用唐鳳的詩作,作為詩意的總結:
‧看見「萬物聯網」,我們將智慧聯網。
看見「虛擬實境」,我們將實境共享。
看見「機器學習」,我們將協力學習
看見「用戶體驗」,我們將體驗人際。
。
聽說「奇點即將接近」--請別忘記:「數位」就在這裡。
• When we see “internet of things”, let's make it an internet of beings.
• When we see “virtual reality”, let's make it a shared reality.
• When we see “machine learning", let's make it collaborative learning.
• When we see “user experience", let's make it about human experience.
• When we hear “the singularity is near", let us remember: the plurality is here.

"Plural languages"
helped my understanding!
●
When I first saw this poem in English,
I didn't quite understand it.
It became clearer to me after seeing the Mandarin version.
Is it the power
of the road?

In "Why I am a Pluralist"
about "Plural Thinking”
Whether one subscribes to versions of the
Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis,
according to which some thoughts are
unthinkable in some languages, or softer
accounts, clearly some languages are better
adapted to expressing certain thoughts
than are others, so these linguistic
differences matter in some ways and reflect
the conditions of the societies that host them.
ある言語は他の言語よりも特定の考えを表現しやすい

![image](https://gyazo.com/3078a19e2d9944b822cefd53cd92db7a/thumb/1000)
Speakers of languages with a vocabulary that
describes a concept in greater detail can
handle that concept more efficiently.
ある概念をより詳細に説明する語彙を持つ言語の話者は、その概念をより効率的に扱うことができる

![image](https://gyazo.com/3ee3ddc5cc3d5947f221ec37548fb225/thumb/1000)
Sometimes a word in one language
have no corresponding word
in the other language 別の言語には対応する単語がないことがある
●
Example: In a discussion on "democratic processes" at
Code for Japan, a participant expressed the opinion:
"Democratic process is a process that generates as much
₁ (Nattoku) feelings as possible among a wide range of
people.
“民主的プロセスとはなるべく多くの人の納得感を生み出すプロセスだ”
""
• I felt 1 (Nattoku) on the opinion.
●
But... how to translate (Nattoku) into English?

![image](https://gyazo.com/172deac36f01e0a871a16b57c07debf3/thumb/1000)
(Nattoku)
'' can be translated as
'agreement' or 'understanding' in English
Japanese
納得
English
Agreement
Understanding

![image](https://gyazo.com/e269ba0b51ea422ed034347988528227/thumb/1000)
(Nattoku)
However, I feel that 'agreement' is more
akin to '', and 'understanding' to ''
Japanese
合意
納得
理解
English
Agreement
Understanding

![image](https://gyazo.com/d26d91e17f61d3721f37c7fecce877ec/thumb/1000)
(Nattoku)
There is a void in English.
Japanese
合意
納得
理解
English
Agreement
Void
Understanding

![image](https://gyazo.com/53d171d5105b3cd5472d6e653a4e1187/thumb/1000)
All languages are full of voids
So we need to collaborate
There is a void in English,
but it's not a problem unique to English.
All languages are full of voids,
and when we think in only one language,
we fail to notice them.
• That's why we need to collaborate with speakers of
different languages.

Japan is hierarchy+consensus
• Japan is
extremely hierarchical,
but extremely focused on
consensus, a kind of outlier.
Many Japanese think the
culture outdated in an era of
global communication.
I agree. We need to change
our mindset and behavior.
. However, Japanese
vocabulary may help
understand the social
harmony in higher
resolution.
Research by Erin Meyer
Mapping Leadership Cultures
Attitudes toward decision making can range along a continuum from strongly top-down to strongly
consensual; attitudes toward authority can vary from extremely egalitarian to extremely hierarchical.
The positions for the 19 countries shown on this map were determined from interviews conducted
between 2003 and 2016.
