[[Advanced Voice]]で[[英会話]]練習


- “Hello.”
- こんにちは！どのようなお手伝いをいたしましょうか？
- “Can you speak English?”
- Sure, I can speak English. How can I help you today?
- “I want to practice my English conversation skills.”
- Great! Let's practice your English conversation skills. What would you like to talk about?

英会話の練習がスタートした
- 先に“I want to practice my English conversation skills.”って言ったパターンでは日本語で練習方法の説明をされたので英会話に切り替える上では“Can you speak English?”が安牌か


複雑な概念を伝えようとしてしどろもどろになったが、綺麗な英語で返してくれた
- “Yes, I'm interested in, uh...”
- That's great! What specifically interests you about Blue Sky?
- “I'm sorry, I want to say, I want to express my idea. I'm interested in how to introduce new components in BlueSky, which that is, I mean, that is, I want to put components which show an argument, an opinion, and the reader can react with it, voting agree or disagree. Could you, can I, did I make sense?”
- Yes, you made sense! So you're interested in introducing a component in Blue Sky that shows opinions and allows readers to react by voting "agree" or "disagree." That sounds like a great idea!
- “Yes, thank you for cleaning my sentence. I want practice to speaking it, so let's”
- You're welcome!
- “I tried to repeat your sentence earlier. I mean, I want to introduce a new component.”
- That's a good start!
- “to show opinion, which allows leaders to vote on it with agree or disagree, correct?”
- Perfect! You expressed your idea clearly. Keep practicing, and you'll become even more fluent!
- “Thank you!”

いいなと思ったが、途中から文中でインタラプトされることが増えて、それから反応しなくなってしまった、まだ不安定？
- この件、サーバサイドが不安定なのか、Wifiアクセスポイントのある部屋から出て浴室で使おうとしたせいかわからないので今後調査

broad listeningの話をすると「I'm familier with broad listening!」と言われる
- “I'm interested in broad reasoning. Do you know?”
- Yes, I'm familiar with broad listening. It involves gathering diverse opinions to understand public sentiment. Are you thinking about how to implement broad listening in digital democracy?
- 圧倒的知識量！

- “I think it can be used for understanding a large amount of information, such as books, not only public opinion.”
- Absolutely! Visualizing data can help uncover patterns and insights across various forms of information, including books. It's a powerful tool for making sense of complex data.
- “Do you have any advice for that?”
- To effectively analyze large datasets like books, you could use techniques like topic modeling or sentiment analysis. Visual tools and interactive dashboards can also help you and others explore the data more intuitively. Have you tried any of these approaches?
- “I think sentiment analysis is not suitable for books because books is not expressing sentiment, it is a bunch of information.”
- You're right. Books often contain complex information rather than just sentiment. In that case, topic modeling or thematic analysis could be more suitable. These methods help identify and categorize the main topics or themes in the text. Have you considered trying those approaches?
- “I feel topic modeling is less powerful.”
- Topic modeling can have its limitations. For a more powerful approach, you might consider combining different techniques, such as network analysis or clustering, to uncover relationships and patterns. This could provide a deeper understanding of the content. What do you think?
- “I mean, the concept of topic is to”
- I see what you mean.
- “fine-grained, too fine-grained, too small piece of information. But the components to build up an understanding should be more large components.”
- I understand. Focusing on broader, more comprehensive components can provide a clearer understanding of the overall content. Have you considered using larger thematic categories or clusters to group information? This might help in building a more cohesive understanding.


振り返りをする
- “Now, recap my conversation log and point out the mistake of English.”
- Sure, here's a brief recap and some corrections:
    - You introduced yourself as a software engineer and mentioned your doctoral work in visualization of high-dimensional data. You also discussed digital democracy and your use of Talk to the City for broad listening. Finally, we talked about improving Wi-Fi connectivity and using extenders.
- Your English is quite good, but here are a few minor corrections:
    - Instead of "I work as software engineer," say "I work as a software engineer."
    - Instead of "It become broken," say "It became broken."
    - Instead of "I should upgrade my Wi-Fi facility," say "I should upgrade my Wi-Fi setup."
- Keep practicing, you're doing great!

今は多分できないけど、そのうち論文を読ませてその内容について話すとか、英語のYouTube動画を見ながら話すとかができるようになるといいな
