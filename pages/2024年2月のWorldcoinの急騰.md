- The rise in the value of Worldcoin (WLD) in February 2024 can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the release of OpenAI's 'Sora' video tool has contributed to the surge in Worldcoin's value, with the token experiencing a significant increase in price and trading activity.

- Additionally, a notable transaction by a cryptocurrency whale, which earned $2.15 million from WLD within a two-day span, has also drawn attention to Worldcoin and likely influenced its price movement.

- The surge in Worldcoin's value is also linked to the release of its tokenomics, which revealed that the WLD supply will be capped at 10 billion tokens for 15 years, after which the network's governance can decide to implement an inflation rate of up to 1.5%. This information about the tokenomics and the allocation of tokens has likely influenced investor confidence and contributed to the positive sentiment surrounding Worldcoin.

- In summary, the rise in Worldcoin's value in February 2024 can be attributed to various factors, including the release of OpenAI's 'Sora' video tool, a significant transaction by a cryptocurrency whale, positive long-term price predictions, and the release of Worldcoin's tokenomics. These developments have contributed to growing investor interest and confidence in Worldcoin's potential, leading to an increase in its value.

色々言ってるけど2日で$2.15 million買い付けたせいでしょ、流動性が低いから跳ね上がった
- それ自体を意図して取引してる可能性もあると思うよ、つまりSoraリリースに被せた[[仕手]]
    - [仕手 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BB%95%E6%89%8B)
- Soraは2/15、それより先に値動きが始まってる、[[インサイダー]]の可能性もあるな

憶測はさておき事実としては、2024-02-21時点で僕がWorldcoinからもらった金額が6万円くらいになったということ
