title: "意思決定は、相反する意見の衝突に基づいて行われるべきだ"
---

> Decisions of the kind the executive has to make are not made well by acclamation. They are made well only if based on the clash of conflicting views, the dialogue between different points of view, the choice between different judgements. The first rule in decision-making is that one does not make a decision unless there is disagreement.
[[The Effective Executive]] [[Peter Drucker]]

> 成果をあげる者は、意図的に意見の不一致をつくりあげる。 そうすることによって、もっともらしいが間違っている意見や、不完全な意見によってだまされることを防ぐ。
