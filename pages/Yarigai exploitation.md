<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> "やりがい搾取" (Yarigai Sakushu) is a critical term in contemporary Japanese culture, particularly in the context of work and employment. It combines "[[やりがい]]" ([[yarigai]]), meaning a sense of fulfillment or reward from doing something, and "搾取" (sakushu), meaning [[exploitation]]. Here's an explanation for those unfamiliar with Japanese culture:

- Exploitation of Fulfillment: Yarigai Sakushu refers to a situation where employers exploit their employees' desire for fulfilling work. Companies may encourage workers to undertake extra tasks or work longer hours without adequate compensation by emphasizing the rewarding nature of the work or appealing to their sense of duty and passion.

- Workplace Culture Issue: This concept has emerged in response to a growing recognition in Japan that some employers may take advantage of employees' willingness to work hard for personal fulfillment, thereby overburdening them without just compensation or recognition.

- Criticism of Work Practices: Yarigai Sakushu is often used as a critique of workplace practices that unduly emphasize the intrinsic rewards of work (like personal growth, satisfaction, or a sense of purpose) at the expense of fair pay, work-life balance, and employee well-being.

- Reflection of Changing Attitudes: The term reflects changing attitudes among the Japanese workforce, particularly among younger generations who are increasingly questioning long-standing work norms and seeking a better balance between job satisfaction and other aspects of life.

- Broader Implications: While rooted in a Japanese context, the concept of Yarigai Sakushu highlights a universal issue in modern work culture, where the lines between personal fulfillment and exploitation can sometimes blur.

In summary, "やりがい搾取" (Yarigai Sakushu) encapsulates a growing concern in Japanese work culture about the balance between finding personal fulfillment in one's job and being exploited for one's willingness to seek such fulfillment. It's a concept that questions the extent to which personal satisfaction can or should be used as a substitute for fair compensation and treatment in the workplace.
