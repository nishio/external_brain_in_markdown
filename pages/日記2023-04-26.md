Today, due to heavy rain, I switched my booked lesson to online mode. The mode didn't exist before.

In the online mode, the instructor takes note in digital way.
- 良いこともあるが悪いこともある
- 手書きの文字が読めないことはない
- キーボード入力がおぼつかない人がいる
- 書いたノートがデジタルなので転記は楽
- 保存される場所が複数になる問題がある
    - まとめておかないと「受講したはずなのにノートのない日がある」みたいなことになりそう
- なぜか閲覧期限がある
- ノートを読み返してみたんだけど
