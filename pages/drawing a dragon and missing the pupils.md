It stems from a Chinese legend where a dragon painting came to life after the artist added the pupils to its eyes. Here’s an explanation for those unfamiliar with Japanese culture:

- Origin and Meaning: The idiom originally comes from a Chinese story where a painter drew a dragon but deliberately left out the pupils. When asked why, he said that adding the pupils would make the dragon come to life and fly away. Eventually, he added one pupil, and the dragon indeed became alive. The phrase thus came to mean adding the crucial finishing touch that brings a work to life.

- Metaphorical Usage: In a broader sense, "画竜点睛を欠く" is used to describe a situation where something is almost perfect but lacks the critical final detail that would complete it. It's often used to express that something is missing that last element that would elevate it from good to great.

- Application in Various Fields: This idiom can be applied in many contexts, such as in art, writing, music, or even a business project. It highlights the importance of final touches and attention to detail.

- Cultural Significance: In Japanese culture, which values meticulousness and attention to detail, this phrase emphasizes the significance of the final step in any process. It’s a reminder that often, the smallest details can make the biggest difference.

- Reflecting Japanese Aesthetics: The idiom also reflects the Japanese aesthetic principle that beauty often lies in the small, nuanced details, and that perfection is achieved by the careful placement of these final touches.

In summary, "画竜点睛を欠く" is a phrase that highlights the importance of the final detail that completes and perfects a work. It encapsulates a cultural appreciation for completeness and the critical role of finishing touches in any endeavor.
