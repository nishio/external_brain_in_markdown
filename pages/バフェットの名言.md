    - Only buy something that you'd be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years.
- I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don't like because you think it will look good on your resume. Isn't that a little like saving up sex for your old age?

- Diversification is a protection against ignorance. It makes very little sense for those who know what they're doing.

- The dumbest reason in the world to buy a stock is because it's going up.
