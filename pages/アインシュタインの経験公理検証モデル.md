[[アインシュタイン]]が友人あての手紙に書いたもの。May 7, 1952

Axiomは経験から生み出されるが、論理的な道筋はなく、直観である。常に修正を繰り返す。
- > there is no logical route leading from the E’s to the A’s, but only an intuitive connection

- (1) The E’s (immediate experiences) are our data.
- (2) The axioms from which we draw our conclusions are indicated by A.
    - Psychologically the A’s depend on the E’s. But there is no logical route leading from the E’s to the A’s, but only an intuitive connection (psychological), which is always “re-turning.”
- (3) Logically, specific statements S, S′, S″ are deduced from A; these statements can lay claim to exactness.
- (4) The A’s are connected to the E’s (verification through experience).
    - Closer examination shows that this procedure also belongs to the extralogical (intuitive) sphere, for the relation between the notions show up in S and the immediate experiences are not logical in nature.
    - But the relation between S’s and E’s is (pragmatically) much less certain than the relation between the A’s and the E’s. (Take the notion “dog” and the corresponding immediate experiences.)
    - If such a relationship could not be set up with a high degree of certainty (though it may be beyond the reach of logic), logical machinery would have no value in the “comprehension of reality” (example: theology).
- What this all boils down to is the eternally problematical connection between the world of ideas and that which can be experienced (immediate experiences of the senses).
- The work for the de Broglie anniversary volume will be translated into French by scholars there. But its contents will be a heresy of the worst order for the people. I can not send it to you until it is printed.

- de Broglie anniversary volumeとは時期的に Savants et découvertes (Scientists and discoveries), Paris, Albin Michel, 1951. のことだろうか？
