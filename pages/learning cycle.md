Fig: Learning process is a repetition of three phases: [[information gathering]], [[modeling]], [[verification]]

- [[具体]] = [[concrete]] phase
    - [[情報収集]] = [[information gathering]]
    - [[体験]] = [[experience]]
- [[抽象]] = [[abstract_2]] phase
    - [[抽象化]] = [[abstraction]]
    - [[モデル化]] = [[modeling]]
    - [[パターンの発見]] = [[pattern discovery]]
- [[応用]] = [[application]] phase
    - [[実践]] = [[practice]]
    - [[検証]] = [[verification]]
