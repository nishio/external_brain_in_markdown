title: "Bracketing"
---

In Scrapbox, bracketing keywords within text using brackets `[ ]` creates links within the project. This is the most important notation.
External links and text formatting are also done by enclosing them in brackets, like `[* bold]`. Thus, in Scrapbox, such 'markup' actions are referred to as 'Bracketing.'

When using the word 'markup,' there's a tendency to focus on text formatting within a single page. However, when considering the organization of knowledge, inter-page linking is crucial. A notation that enables stress-free linking was essential. Bracketing meets this characteristic and is very effective.
