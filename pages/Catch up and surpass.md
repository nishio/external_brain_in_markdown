<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon' alt='gpt.icon' height="19.5"/> "[[Oitsuke Oikose]]," or "[[追いつけ追い越せ]]" in Japanese, is a motivational phrase that translates roughly to "Catch up and surpass." This expression is used to encourage someone to not only catch up with their rivals or competition, but also to exceed them. It emphasizes the drive for continual improvement and relentless pursuit of excellence, concepts that are deeply ingrained in many aspects of Japanese society.

The phrase may be used in a variety of contexts, such as sports, education, or business. For example, a coach might use this phrase to motivate a team that's lagging behind in a competition. In a business context, it might be used to inspire a team or company to strive for innovation and outperform competitors.

While this saying does embody the spirit of perseverance and improvement, it is also worth noting that it reflects the intense pressure and competition often present in Japanese society, whether in academics, work, or other aspects of life.
