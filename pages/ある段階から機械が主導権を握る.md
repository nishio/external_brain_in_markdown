[[Alan Turing]] #チューリング
> Alan M. Turing was a major figure in the field of computer science who died in 1954. His mother Sara published a book about his life in 1959, and she included a draft of a lecture he delivered in Manchester, England in 1951. Turing’s address titled “Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory” explored the consequences of building computer systems capable of displaying intelligence. Boldface added to excerpts by QI:
- > There would be plenty to do in trying, say, to keep one’s intelligence up to the standard set by the machines, for it seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. There would be no question of the machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control, in the way that is mentioned in Samuel Butler’s Erewhon.

- 例えば、自分の知能を機械が設定した水準に維持しようとすれば、いくらでもできるはずだ、
- というのも、ひとたび機械による思考法が始まれば、私たちの弱々しい力を凌駕するのに時間はかからないと思われるからです。
- 機械が死ぬことはないだろうし、機械同士で会話して知恵を絞ることもできるだろう。
- したがって、サミュエル・バトラーの『エレホン』で語られているように、ある段階から機械が主導権を握ることを期待しなければならない。
